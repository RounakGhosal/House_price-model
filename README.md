I have created a web application which will take many features from the user and will show them the predicted price of an appartment in which they are interested in.This will help them to arrange the money.
Here I trained the model using Boston Dataset from Kaggle and used Linear Regression for evaluation.
Backend is created by using Flask and the user interface is created using HTML,CSS and JavaScript.
If you do havee any suggestions please give a feedback....Thank you....
